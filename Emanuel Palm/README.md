# Treasure Hunting in Azure with KQL as Your Map - Emanuel Palm

Full demo KQL and slides for Emanuel's presentation at NIC Rebel Edition in Oslo 2025 can be found at [PalmEmanuel/NIC2025](https://github.com/PalmEmanuel/nic2025).

Demos used the Visual Studio Code Extension [bARGE - boosted Azure Resource Graph Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PalmEmanuel.barge-vscode), and [StageCoder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EngstromJimmy.stagecoderVSCode).

## Session synopsis

When working in Azure we often encounter situations where it would be useful, or even necessary to take a look at the bigger picture. A powerful way to do so is using Kusto Query Language paired with Azure Resource Graph.

How does this resource relate to the configuration of the rest of my environment?
Do I have any virtual machines exposed to the internet?
How many of my resources are using the correct encryption keys?

What if we could get reports and dashboards on any query, or alerts when our custom criteria was met?

In this session we will learn efficient ways of gaining insights and understanding our environment through KQL queries in Azure Resource Graph. We'll dive into use cases, examples and an overview of the language.

When the session is over, you'll be able to use it as the treasure map for your own cloud.
