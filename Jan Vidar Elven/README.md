# Nordic Infrastructure Conference 2025 - Jan Vidar Elven

Welcome to the resources page for my session at Nordic Infrastructure Conference 2025!

## Session: Security Infrastrucure as Code for Entra ID and Graph API

 This highly technical and demo-heavy session will look into the recent developments and previews of the Graph API resource support from Bicep and Terraform, and compare usage scenarios to those already available via Terraform and Azure AD/Entra ID provider. We will look into how to combine traditional Azure resource deployments together with Entra ID and Graph API resources, moving even more deployment scenarios to declarative infrastructure-as-code, both for local deployment and for DevOps pipelines or actions.

## Session: License to Assist - Bringing AI Agents to Entra ID

 In this session I want to share some of the exciting work I have been doing on using AI Agents and bringing AI to assist with Entra ID IAM, Security and Governance scenarios. What can you do with Security Copilot and Entra Skills? How you can use Declarative Agents with Teams Toolkit and Copilot Studio to use Graph API and own API's to support your own scenarios and needs. And last we will look into recent developments like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and where Entra ID towards to the end of 2025 is with it's own AI Agents built into the Entra management portal. This session will have practical walkthrough and takeaways, come for the demos and leave with the inspiration and solutions!
